# Building the Future of Streaming at FOX

During my time with FOX Consumer Products & Engineering, I led several high-impact initiatives focused on advancing FOX‚Äôs video platform across tvOS and mobile. As both a hands-on engineer and a strategic contributor, I worked at the intersection of product, engineering, and platform strategy.

## üì∫ Architecting tvOS Support

One of my primary responsibilities was architecting and implementing tvOS support for FOX‚Äôs mobile video player SDK. I served as the **tvOS tech lead**, partnering closely with engineering teams across the FOX app suite (FOX Now, Sports, Weather, Nation, and Fox News International) to provide technical guidance and integration support.

This cross-functional role positioned me as a trusted embedded-resource within FOX, helping drive platform consistency and performance across a broad portfolio of consumer-facing apps.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Streamlining Delivery Pipelines

To improve efficiency and reduce manual toil, I automated multiple stages of the **continuous delivery pipeline**, which led to a **25% reduction in release cycle time**. These efforts not only accelerated engineering velocity but also improved reliability and traceability across builds.

Additionally, I created and open-sourced a custom **Changelog Generator** ‚Äî a CLI tool designed to resolve merge conflicts and automate changelog generation across teams. This tool saved **dozens of hours each release cycle** and continues to benefit teams beyond its original scope.

## üí° Driving Innovation & Stakeholder Alignment

Innovation was a core part of my FOX engagement. I **evangelized SharePlay** within the organization, developing a working proof of concept and presenting it to **VP- and C-level stakeholders**. The initiative received official buy-in and positive feedback from FOX‚Äôs VP of Video Platforms and WillowTree‚Äôs executive team.

I also played a key role in organizing and leading cross-functional **discussions on feature design and video stack architecture**, helping teams align on shared goals and technical direction.

## üå± Mentorship & Team Growth

Beyond technical work, I invested in the growth and development of fellow engineers by **mentoring newer team members**. I view mentorship as a multiplier ‚Äî helping others level up ultimately improves team output, culture, and resilience.

This chapter of my career reflects a blend of deep technical ownership, platform innovation, and collaborative leadership ‚Äî all in service of delivering premium streaming experiences at scale.
