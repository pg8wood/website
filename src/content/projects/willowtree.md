At WillowTree, I partnered with clients including FOX, Pepsi, CFA Institute, Locus Health, and more to design and ship polished, high-traffic apps.

Served as embedded tech lead for FOX's video SDK and tvOS apps, created a SharePlay prototype demoed to executives, and co-developed **Vocable AAC**, an award-winning ARKit app for hands-free communication.

Contributed as a senior engineer and mentor, scaling pipelines, guiding architecture, and championing developer well-being and sustainability across teams.
