# Engineering Across Industries: My Journey at WillowTree

**WillowTree, LLC**  
üìç _July 2018 ‚Äì August 2022_  
_Software Engineer ‚Üí Platform Software Engineer ‚Üí Senior Software Engineer_

During my four years at WillowTree, I led and contributed to a wide range of mobile and platform projects for Fortune 500 companies, award-winning startups, and community-focused initiatives. Though my job title evolved, the constant thread was crafting resilient software, improving team health, and delivering measurable client impact.

Each project at WillowTree felt like working at a new company with distinct clients, domains, tech stacks, and team dynamics. To reflect this variety, I‚Äôve included individual blurbs for each major engagement below.

## ü¶ä FOX Consumer Products & Engineering

I served as **tvOS tech lead** and cross-platform architect on FOX‚Äôs mobile video player SDK, enabling support for FOX Now, Sports, Weather, Nation, and News International. I reduced CI release time by 25%, created an open-sourced changelog generator to eliminate merge pain, and evangelized SharePlay, even demoing a working prototype to VPs and C-level stakeholders.

## üì∫ FOX Television Stations

I launched **8 new white-label TV apps** and scaled CI support to 27 markets. I also identified a recurring pain point: merge conflicts in `.xcodeproj` files. I proposed a shift to **XcodeGen**, converting an 80k-line `.pbxproj` into a 200-line YAML config, rolled out across all 27 apps, saving 10+ person-hours per sprint.

## üß† Vocable AAC

One of my proudest contributions: I co-designed and built a hands-free ARKit communication app for speech-impaired users, powered by head-tracking and a virtual cursor. The project was **open-sourced**, won multiple **Webby and W3 awards**, and enabled meaningful community collaboration around accessibility tech.

---

## üì± WillowTree Live Apps Team

Onboarded and maintained **10 mature codebases** inherited from clients, while integrating their CI/CD pipelines into WillowTree‚Äôs internal stack. During the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, I rapidly implemented an emergency in-app feature for Wyndham Hotels to deliver guidance to guests. I was cited by the client as a reason for contract renewal.

---

## ‚ù§Ô∏è Health & Wellness Client

I joined a **burnt-out team** mid-project and helped revitalize team culture through transparent communication, time-off advocacy, and healthy processes. This directly translated into performance: we successfully launched a HealthKit-integrated rewards feature, turning the project from red to green.

---

## üè• Locus Health

While working on secure patient data flows, I discovered and resolved a privacy concern involving improper health data encryption. I also collaborated on architecture for 2FA via Amazon Cognito, helping fortify patient authentication flows.

---

## üìö CFA Institute

As lead iOS engineer for eight months, I shipped major features like Member Renewal and Search. I designed the **full-stack implementation**, provided API architecture for client teams, and reduced regression testing time by 50% with a robust automation suite. I also organized ART discussions during SAFe PI Planning.

---

## ü•§ PepsiCo

I led the cleanup and modernization of PepsiCo‚Äôs iOS app, including Swift 4 migration and API client consolidation. I promoted the use of `Codable`, removed a third-party JSON parser, and collaborated with design to optimize Lottie animation performance across devices.

---

Across all of these engagements, I balanced platform architecture, client communication, mentorship, and day-to-day implementation. My time at WillowTree was a masterclass in adaptability, collaboration, and technical depth: a launchpad that shaped me into the engineer I am today. From leading client conversations to untangling gnarly build systems, I gained hands-on experience across industries, teams, and tools, and learned how to build with care, no matter the challenge.
