In 2016, I explored Apple’s brand-new ARKit framework through undergraduate research at Virginia Tech. At the time, ARKit was under‑documented and rarely used at real-world scale, so I set out to push its limits with a campus-wide AR navigation prototype. I built a full documentation site with tutorials, experiments, and a working companion app (VT AR Tour) to help others explore ARKit’s potential in real environments.
