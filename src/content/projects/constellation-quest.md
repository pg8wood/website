Sole developer and product partner for the Seven Stars Festival’s companion app: an offline‑first, puzzle‑driven PWA used on‑site to guide attendees through constellation clues and a QR‑scanned finale.

I implemented the end‑to‑end flow (UX, game logic, service‑worker caching, touch targets), collaborated with the festival team on puzzle pacing and copy, and advised operations on scanning hardware and QR placement to keep lines moving in low‑connectivity areas. Beyond build‑out, partnered with the team to refine the fan experience beyond the screen.

- Role: Sole developer; product/ops partner
- Focus: Offline reliability, touch‑first UX, QR ops
- Tech: TypeScript, Vite, PWA (Service Worker), SVG/Canvas
