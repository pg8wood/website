## ✨ Connecting the Seven Stars... Offline

**Constellation Quest** was a custom-built scavenger hunt experience designed for the Seven Stars Festival: a real-world event celebrating creativity, connection, and cosmic curiosity.

I architected the entire experience as an **offline-first progressive web app**, using **Vite, TypeScript, and localStorage** to create a smooth, installable experience that required zero backend infrastructure. Festivalgoers explored themed clues embedded in a custom **star map puzzle**, with progress tracked per device. The app was designed to be intuitive for non-technical users while delighting power users with subtle polish and thematic depth.

The project was a **gold mine for experience in rapid prototyping, constraint-driven design, and user empathy**. With no backend and limited on-site connectivity, I had to ensure the entire experience felt seamless, engaging, and resilient from onboarding to completion. I leaned into accessible interaction patterns, whimsical visuals, and frictionless UX to match the festival’s playful tone.

**Constellation Quest** reflects my ability to blend **technical execution with narrative design** — delivering real-world magic through carefully scoped engineering and thoughtful user experience.
