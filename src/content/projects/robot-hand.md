Founded and operated as my independent software studio, Robot Hand, LLC is where I design and ship the products I imagine from start to finish—sometimes client-facing, sometimes purely for fun.

Under the Robot Hand banner, I’ve released tools like Emochi, a lightning-fast emoji picker for macOS, and Recipe Nabber, a Safari extension that cuts straight to the recipe content. The studio also serves as my publishing identity for projects like Constellation Quest, an offline-first festival companion app built for GriZ LLC.

Robot Hand is the space where I explore ideas without committee approval—combining aesthetic polish, technical rigor, and a dash of humor to make small pieces of software that feel alive.
