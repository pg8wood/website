As founder of **Robot Hand, LLC**, I‚Äôve built tools, products, and playful experiences that blend technical craft with personality. From shipping open-source CLIs to architecting offline-first progressive web apps, Robot Hand has become both a creative outlet and a proving ground where I experiment, refine, and ship at my own pace (FAST).

While my professional work often lives inside scaled organizations, **Robot Hand is where I get to build fast, weird, and with intent**. It‚Äôs where I stretch what I know and prove that good software can be useful _and_ delightful.

### üõ†Ô∏è Tools for Developers, Built by a Developer

- **`taipo`** ‚Äî An AI-powered CLI tool that detects and fixes common shell command typos before they break your flow. Trained on real terminal mistakes and optimized for speed.
- **`slog`** ‚Äî A utility for automating Simulator login flows, published via Homebrew and used by fellow iOS engineers to bypass repetitive test setup steps.
- **`changelog-generator`** ‚Äî A release tool that eliminates the headache of changelog merge conflicts ‚Äî originally built to solve a pain point at Square, now open-source for anyone to adopt.

These tools solve real problems I‚Äôve encountered in my own workflows. And if they save me time, I know they‚Äôll save others time too. That philosophy drives nearly everything I release under the Robot Hand umbrella.

### üåå Building Cosmic Experiences

One of Robot Hand;s core values is about **creating moments of wonder**. During the Seven Stars Festival, I designed and shipped **Constellation Quest**, an offline-first scavenger hunt experience powered by Vite, TypeScript, and localStorage. Festivalgoers explored a custom SVG star map, solving clues embedded in constellations, all without needing Wi-Fi or a login screen.

Constellation Quest embodied my favorite kind of indie dev work: small in scope, big in imagination, and technically invisible to the user.

### üí° An Engine for Ideas

Everything I build under Robot Hand has a purpose:

- Test out emerging APIs and frameworks in the wild
- Solve developer workflow pain with empathy and polish
- Explore playful or narrative-driven experiences that wouldn‚Äôt fit in a traditional product roadmap

It‚Äôs also a sandbox for branding, copy, UX, and creative risk and a place where I can explore what it means to make **software that feels alive**.

**Robot Hand** is where I _experiment, publish, and play_ in the open. It reflects the kind of builder I am at my core: technically sharp, emotionally attuned, and always looking to make tools or experiences that others didn‚Äôt know they needed... until now.
