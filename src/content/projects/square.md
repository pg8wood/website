At Square, I architect and ship foundational systems that underpin every sale made across the company's suite of POS apps.

Highlights include **Predicate Builder**, a declarative, type-safe approach to Core Data predicates now open-sourced; founding the **Copilot for Xcode Working Group** to bring generative AI tooling to all Block iOS engineers; and introducing **Swift Macros** to automate boilerplate and compile-time safety.

Beyond code, I led multi-team rollouts of seller-facing features, revived orphaned APIs through clear ownership processes, and spearheaded documentation unification efforts that cut discovery time from minutes to seconds.
