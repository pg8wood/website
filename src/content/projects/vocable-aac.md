## 🗣️ Vocable AAC

**Vocable** was more than a technical project: it was a mission to build accessible, empowering technology for people who rely on alternative ways to communicate. I co-designed and implemented a **hands-free communication system** using ARKit, head tracking, and a virtual cursor, allowing speech-impaired users to interact with the app using only subtle head movements.

From the start, I advocated for **open-sourcing the project**, believing that this kind of technology should be freely available, remixable, and extended by the community. I helped steer the exec team toward that vision, contributed detailed **contributing guidelines**, and led early conversations with contributors after launch to make sure they felt supported and included.

To make the app globally usable, I implemented **localization support** and laid the groundwork for translation into as many languages as possible.

The response was overwhelming: **Vocable became a 2021 Webby Award winner and honoree**, and received **2020 W3 Awards in three categories**. But more importantly, it reached people who needed it, and opened the door for future collaboration around accessible tech.
