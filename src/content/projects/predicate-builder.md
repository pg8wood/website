Architected and shipped a safer Core Data layer across Square's POS ecosystem by building **Predicate Builder** â€” a declarative, compile-time-checked way to write fetch predicates.

The initiative eliminated entire classes of runtime crashes and cut development and review time by 40%, establishing a new internal standard later open-sourced by Square.
