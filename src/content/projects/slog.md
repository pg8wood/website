A tiny CLI that launches your iOS Simulator app and taps through the login screen so you don’t have to—putting you one command away from being logged in.

---

Highlights:

- Automates username/password login flows in Simulator
- Saves/loads config at `~/.slog.json`
- Quick `add`/`switch` for apps, accounts, and devices
- Optional REPL to record and run post‑login scripts
