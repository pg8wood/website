Hugo is an awesome open-source static site generator with a super active community.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve chosen Hugo as my blog framework so I can learn more about static site generators and have a place to post some write-ups of what I\u0026rsquo;m up to without needing to manually create my site or need to worry about a CMS. My blog is focused on content, so Hugo is a great fit.\nRight off the bat I can see how flexible this tool is as I see my site hot-reloading while the Hugo server observes changes in my Markdown.\n",
