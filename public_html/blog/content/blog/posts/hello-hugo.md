Welcome! You've found my first blog post. [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) is an awesome open-source static site generator with a super active community. 

I've chosen Hugo as my blog framework so I can learn more about static site generators and have a place to post some write-ups of what I'm up to without needing to manually create my site or need to worry about a CMS. My blog is focused on content, so Hugo is a great fit. 

Right off the bat I can see how flexible this tool is as I see my site hot-reloading while the Hugo server observes changes in my Markdown.
