If you've never thought about how links to your site look when shared, they probably look like this:

<div align=center>
    <img width=25% src="/images/2020/boring-link.png" />
</div>

Luckily, transforming your links into enticing, tappable calls to action is just a matter of adding a few `meta` tags. And with Hugo's layout templating system, you can set it up once and forget it.

    <figcaption>iMessage</figcaption>
  </figure>
