            <section>
            <p>Note: This application builds on concepts learned in the <a href="../arkit-hello-world/tutorial.html">ARKit
                Hello World tutorial</a>.</p>

            <br/>
            <h3>Learning Objectives</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>How to perform a hit test to determine plane collision</li>
                <li>How to render a 3D SceneKit model in ARKit</li>
                <li>How to apply physics to SceneKit models</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Foreword: Software Life Cycle</h3>
            <p>Even with smaller applications, the <a
                    href="https://manta.cs.vt.edu/cs3714/StudentsOnly/Handouts/SELifeCycle.html" target="_blank">software
                life cycle</a> is crucial to developing and maintaining high-quality software. This tutorial encompasses
                only the <i>programming</i>
                process of the cycle.</p>

            <h3>Application Functionality</h3>
            <p>This is a universal application that will run on iPhone 6s and up and iPad Pro and up.</p>
            <p>The tutorial teaches how to create a 3D SceneKit model, render it in augmented reality, and apply physics
                to the object in real time.</p>


            <h3>Creating the project</h3>
            <p>This project requires Xcode 9.0 and above.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Launch Xcode and select <b>Create a new Xcode project</b> from the Xcode welcome screen, or select
                    <b>File
                        → New → Project...</b></li>
                <li>Choose <b> iOS → Application → Augmented Reality App</b> and click next.<br><img
                        src="../common-images/application-type-selection.png" width="70%"/></li>
                <li>In the <i>Choose options for your new project</i> dialog, choose <b>SceneKit</b> as the <i>Content
                    Technology</i><img
                        src="../common-images/scenekit.png" width="70%"/></li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Configuring Your Environment</h3>
            <p>Creating a new ARKit project generates a sample application, so some cleanup is required.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>In ViewController.swift, delete the sample code from <code>viewDidLoad()</code>.<br><img
                        src="../common-images/viewDidLoad.png" width="70%"/></li>
                <li>Delete everything inside the art.scnassets folder. <br><img src="../common-images/art.png"
                                                                                width="70%"/></li>
            </ol>

            <p>Create a new AR Session using the technique learned in the <a href="../arkit-hello-world/tutorial.html">ARKit
                Hello World tutorial</a>. Follow the tutorial steps in order to start dynamically tracking horizontal
                planes. The rest of the tutorial assumes you have followed these steps.</p>

            <h3>Performing a Hit Test</h3>
            <p>When the user taps the screen in an AR application, ARKit records the 2D coordinates of the touch. In
                order to convert the 2D coordinates of the touch to real-world 3D coordinates, ARKit performs a "hit
                test." This test works as if the user's touch had fired a vector from the device's camera's origin
                through a 3D point created by projecting the 2D touch point into the 3D view. This 3D point is
                recorded.</p>
            <p>If the 3D point lies on a detected horizontal plane, the hit test is a success. In this tutorial, we will
                use hit testing to allow the user to place 3D cubes in AR.</p>
            <p>To create a hit test routine, first create a Tap Gesture Recognizer by opening your Main.storyboard and
                searching the Object library. Drag the Tap Gesture Recognizer object into your ViewController's Scene
                View. Your View Controller Scene should now look like this:</p>
            <img src="images/tap-gesture-recognizer.png"/>
            <p>Next, open the Assistant Editor to your Main.storyboard and your ViewController.swift. Implement an
                action method that will be called when the Tap Gesture Recognizer is recognized.</p>
            <p>Copy the documented code given below. <b>Carefully study the code, understand what it is doing, and learn
                from it!</b></p>
            <pre><code>
// MARK: - Gesture Handling Action methods

@IBAction func userTappedScreen(_ sender: UITapGestureRecognizer) {
    // Get the 2D point of the touch in the SceneView
    let tapPoint: CGPoint = sender.location(in: self.sceneView)

    // Conduct the hit test on the SceneView
    let hitTestResults: [ARHitTestResult] = sceneView.hitTest(tapPoint, types: .existingPlaneUsingExtent)

    if hitTestResults.isEmpty {
        return
    }

    // Arbitrarily pick the closest plane in the case of multiple results
    let result: ARHitTestResult = hitTestResults[0]

    // The position of the ARHitTestResult relative to the world coordinate system
    // The 3rd column in the matrix corresponds the the position of the point in the coordinate system
    let resultPositionMatrixColumn = result.worldTransform.columns.3

    // Position the node slightly above the hit test's position in order to show off gravity later
    let targetPosition: SCNVector3 = SCNVector3Make(resultPositionMatrixColumn.x, resultPositionMatrixColumn.y + /* insertion offset of ~50 cm */ 0.5, resultPositionMatrixColumn.z)

    // This method is implemented in the next section of the tutorial.
    addCubeAt(targetPosition)
}
            </code></pre>
            <p>Connect your action method to the gesture recognizer by holding the control key and dragging from the Tap
                Gesture Recognizer to your action method.</p>
            <h3>Adding 3D Virtual Content</h3>
            <p>In SceneKit, <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/scenekit/scngeometry">SCNGeometry</a>
                objects can be attached to the previously-seen SCNNode objects to create realistic visuals. One of the
                simplest Geometry types is the <a
                        href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/scenekit/scnbox#relationships">SCNBox</a>
                object: a "six-sided polyhedron geometry whose whose faces are all rectangles, optionally with rounded
                edges and corners." Basically, a cube.</p>
            <p>To create a SCNBox, you must define the shape in terms of its width, height, and length. You must then
                apply the SCNBox to a SCNNode wrapper and place the SCNNode in the sceneView.</p>
            <p>Copy the documented code given below. <b>Carefully study the code, understand what it is doing, and learn
                from it!</b></p>
            <pre><code>
// Adds a cube to the sceneView at the given position
func addCubeAt(_ position: SCNVector3) {
    // .01 = roughly 10cm
    let cubeGeometry: SCNBox = SCNBox.init(
        width: 0.1, height: 0.1, length: 0.1, chamferRadius: 0)

    // Node that the geometry is applied to
    let cubeNode = SCNNode.init(geometry: cubeGeometry)
    cubeNode.position = position

    // Add the node to the scene
    sceneView.scene.rootNode.addChildNode(cubeNode)

    sceneView.autoenablesDefaultLighting = true
}
            </code></pre>
            <p>Now build and launch your application. Find a horizontal plane, and once it's detected, tap the screen
                and a cube will appear! </p>
            <div align="center">
                <img src="images/cube-addition.PNG" width="30%"/>
            </div>

            <h3>Physics Engine</h3>
            <p>SceneKit includes a realistic physics engine that "performs physics calculations on physics bodies
                attached to nodes in the scene." To tell SceneKit that it should apply physics to an object, you must
                attach a <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/scenekit/scnphysicsbody">SCNPhysicsBody</a>
                to your object.</p>
            <p>Add the following code to your <code>addCubeAt()</code> method.</p>
            <pre><code>
// Add Physics Body to the cube
let physicsBody: SCNPhysicsBody = SCNPhysicsBody(type: SCNPhysicsBodyType.dynamic, shape: nil)
physicsBody.mass = 2.0; // 2kg
cubeNode.physicsBody = physicsBody
            </code></pre>
            <p>Now your cubes will obey gravity, but they'll fall forever! In order to prevent this, you must set up
                collision detection.</p>
            <h3>Collision Detection</h3>
            <p>In order to have objects collide instead of pass through each other, each object must have a <a
                    href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/scenekit/scnphysicsbody">SCNPhysicsBody</a> attached
                to it.</p>
            <p>Add this following lines to your <code>addCubeAt()</code> method in order to give your cubes their
                physics bodies</p>
            <pre><code>
// Add Physics Body to the cube
let physicsBody: SCNPhysicsBody = SCNPhysicsBody(type: .dynamic, shape: SCNPhysicsShape(geometry: cubeGeometry, options: nil))
physicsBody.mass = 1.5; // 1.5kg
physicsBody.restitution = 0.25
physicsBody.friction = 0.75
cubeNode.physicsBody = physicsBody
            </code></pre>
            <p>Next, create a helper function to give your planes their physics bodies. This function will be used when
                the renderer detects a new plane and when it updates its size estimation of existing planes. <b>Carefully
                    study the code, understand what it is doing, and learn from it!</b></p>
            <pre><code>
/**
 Creates a new physics body for a plane SCNNode
 */
func createPlanePhysicsBody(forNode: SCNNode, anchor: ARPlaneAnchor) {
    // Create a SCNBox the size of the plane, but 1cm high to prevent the cubes from clipping. SCNPlane has no height, so it is easily clipped through.
    let planeGeometry = SCNBox(width: CGFloat(anchor.extent.x) , height: CGFloat(anchor.extent.z), length: 0.005, chamferRadius: 0)

    // Give the plane a kinematic physics body so other nodes can interact with it, but it never moves and is unaffected by collisions
    let physicsBody: SCNPhysicsBody = SCNPhysicsBody(type: .kinematic, shape: SCNPhysicsShape(geometry: planeGeometry, options: nil))

    physicsBody.restitution = 0.0
    physicsBody.friction = 1.0
    forNode.physicsBody = physicsBody
}
            </code></pre>
            <p>Update your <code>renderer(_ renderer: SCNSceneRenderer, didAdd node: SCNNode, for anchor:
                ARAnchor)</code> method to give your planes a physics body for the cubes to interact with. <b>Carefully
                study the code, understand what it is doing, and learn from it!</b></p>
            <pre><code>

func renderer(_ renderer: SCNSceneRenderer, didAdd node: SCNNode, for anchor: ARAnchor) {
    // Place content only for anchors found by plane detection.
    guard let planeAnchor = anchor as? ARPlaneAnchor else { return }

    // Create a SceneKit plane to visualize the plane anchor using its position and extent.
    let plane = SCNPlane(width: CGFloat(planeAnchor.extent.x), height: CGFloat(planeAnchor.extent.z))
    let planeNode = SCNNode(geometry: plane)
    planeNode.simdPosition = float3(planeAnchor.center.x, 0, planeAnchor.center.z)

    // Give the SCNNode a texture from Assets.xcassets to better visualize the detected plane.
    planeNode.geometry?.firstMaterial?.diffuse.contents = "grid.png" // NOTE: change this string to the name of the file you added

    createPlanePhysicsBody(forNode: planeNode, anchor: planeAnchor)

    /*
     `SCNPlane` is vertically oriented in its local coordinate space, so
     rotate the plane to match the horizontal orientation of `ARPlaneAnchor`.

    planeNode.eulerAngles.x = -.pi / 2

    // Make the plane visualization semitransparent to clearly show real-world placement.
    planeNode.opacity = 0.25

    /*

     changes in the plane anchor as plane estimation continues.
     */
    node.addChildNode(planeNode)
}
            </code></pre>
            <p>In addition, update the node's physics body when the plane estimation is updated in <code>func renderer(_
                renderer: SCNSceneRenderer, didUpdate node: SCNNode, for anchor: ARAnchor)</code>. <b>Carefully study
                the code, understand what it is doing, and learn from it!</b></p>

            <p>Your cubes will now interact with the planes and each other!</p>

            <h3>Saving Memory</h3>
            <p>You may have noticed in your testing that if a cube falls off of a plane, it seems to fall forever. Even
                after the cube is long out of sight, it is still in memory, and the physics engine still includes it in
                calculations every frame. This is undesirable, as if the user adds too many cubes, the device can run
                out of memory.</p>
            <p>To prevent this, you can place a giant, invisible plane at the "bottom" of the world (think slightly
                below the ground). You can use a bitmask to detect which nodes collide, and if a cube collides with the
                bottom plane, you can remove it from memory to save resources.</p>
            <p>To check which nodes are colliding, we will bitwise-AND each node's collision bit mask together and check
                the result against the two bitmasks bitwise-OR-ed together. Add the following two bitmasks below your
                class declaration.</p>
            <pre><code>
let bottomCollisionBitMask = 1 << 0 // 001 = 1
let cubeCollisionBitMask = 1 << 1   // 010 = 2
            </code></pre>
            <p>Add these bitmasks to your objects. In <code>setupWorldBottom()</code> add </p>
            <pre><code>physicsBody.categoryBitMask = bottomCollisionBitMask</code></pre>
            <p>and in <code>addCubeAt()</code> add </p>
            <pre><code>physicsBody.categoryBitMask = cubeCollisionBitMask</code></pre>
            <p>To use these bitmasks, the viewcontroller must implement the <a
                    href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/scenekit/scnphysicscontactdelegate">SCNPhysicsContactDelegate</a>
                methods. Add the SCNPhysicsContactDelegate to your class declaration and implement the following
                function: </p>
            <pre><code>
 // MARK: - SCNPhysicsContactDelegate

/**
 Tests if the cube collided with the bottom plane and removes it if true
 */
func physicsWorld(_ world: SCNPhysicsWorld, didBegin contact: SCNPhysicsContact) {
    let mask = contact.nodeA.physicsBody!.categoryBitMask | contact.nodeB.physicsBody!.categoryBitMask

    if mask == [bottomCollisionBitMask, cubeCollisionBitMask] {
        if contact.nodeA.physicsBody!.categoryBitMask == CollisionTypes.bottom.rawValue {
            contact.nodeB.removeFromParentNode()
        } else {
            contact.nodeA.removeFromParentNode()
        }
    }
}
            </code></pre>
            <p>Congratulations! You have completed the tutorial, and your implementation is now memory-efficient!</p>
