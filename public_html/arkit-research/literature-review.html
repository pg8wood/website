                <h2>What Is Augmented Reality?</h2>

                <p>Augmented reality is a view of the real world interlaced with computer-generated elements. These
                    elements serve to “augment” the viewing experience via the virtual addition and/or removal of 3D
                    objects, images, sound, and overlays. The term “Augmented Reality” was coined by a Boeing researcher
                    named Tom Caudell in 1990 (Berryman).</p>
                <p>Content is delivered by a wearable or mobile device that processes real-world input and renders the
                    augmented view in real-time. The information provided by the device is often very context-sensitive
                    and interactive, combining input from a variety of sensors (Barfield). The level of scene
                    interactivity can be immensely increased with the addition of computer vision and object recognition
                    libraries.</p>
                <p>While most AR experiences bring virtual information to the user’s immediate surroundings, this is not
                    a requirement. Furht writes that AR can be applied to “any indirect view of the real-world
                    environment, such as a live-video stream.” Furthermore, AR is not necessarily restricted to the
                    sense of sight. While visual AR is by far the most popular, any type of sensory input is eligible
                    for augmentation.</p>

                <h2>The State of the Industry&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: 100">(late 2016)</span> </h2>
                <p>AR is still very much in its infancy. While some enterprise and military applications have been in
                    use since the early 2000s, commercial AR is only now coming to fruition. The first case of a
                    large-scale commercial AR headset was the release of Google Glass and the Glass Explorer Program in
                    2013.</p>
                <p>Four years later, Google and Apple are just now releasing AR SDKs to developers.
                    Until two days ago at the time of writing, Google did not have an AR SDK available to the public,
                    and Apple’s ARKit was released a mere six months ago. Many more small-scale ventures are being
                    developed as well, but the state of the industry as a whole is comparable to the mobile phone market
                    in 2006 (read: pre-iPhone).</p>
                <p>Merel writes that the number one challenge in achieving a viable AR market is developing a “hero”
                    device capable of processing and rendering AR while maintaining all-day battery life. Simply put,
                    consumers are open to AR, but would prefer an AR experience that did not require looking through
                    one’s smartphone camera.</p>
                <p>While computer engineers are working hard on creating such a hero device, the majority of AR
                    development will target mobile phones. The recent release of the aforementioned SDKs has opened many
                    doors for software developers and consumers alike. </p>

                <h2>Applications</h2>
                <p>The use cases of augmented reality are as unlimited as the amount of 3D space around us. Many
                    different applications are under development, including cooking tutorials, games, location-based
                    apps, and virtual menus.</p>
                <p>The most popular augmented reality app on the market is Niantic’s Pokémon Go. While Pokémon Go’s AR
                    component is extremely basic, it is a landmark for the AR industry. Even before the release of
                    ARKit, Pokémon Go’s AR was widely accepted by the public, and the game still has a user base of 65
                    million monthly active users today.</p>

                <h2>ARKit</h2>
                <p>According the Apple Developer documentation, ARKit is “a new framework that allows you to easily
                    create unparalleled augmented reality experiences for iPhone and iPad.” Because of the level of
                    performance required for real-time AR, ARKit is restricted to devices equipped with an A9 processor
                    or above. By combining data from the CoreMotion sensors (accelerometer, gyroscope, pedometer,
                    altimeter, and magnetometer) and the camera, ARKit can track the device’s position and accurately
                    scan the camera scene in front of the device. This method of position tracking is called Visual
                    Inertial Odometry (VIO).</p>
                <p>VIO allows the device to detect horizontal planes, place and anchor virtual objects in the scene, and
                    estimate the scene’s lighting and apply a similar amount of lighting to virtual objects.
                    Unfortunately, light detection will not automatically apply shadows to virtual objects at the time
                    of writing.</p>
                <p>On iPhone X and above, ARKit is able to detect the “position, topology, and expression of the user’s
                    face… in real time” using the TrueDepth camera. By creating a 3D map of the user’s face, ARKit can
                    apply live “selfie” effects or read certain facial expressions. Facial expressions can be used as
                    controls, mimicked by a 3D character, or utilized in other creative ways.</p>
                <p>ARKit works with additional Apple and third-party technologies. Metal, SceneKit, Unity, and Unreal
                    Engine already provide optimizations for ARKit. For example, SceneKit scenes are mapped to the
                    real-world scene by ARKit, so placing an object into a view’s SceneKit scene, the object appears to
                    be anchored to real-world coordinates.</p>
